              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Before getting into the routes, let's explain how we calculated these road trip cost breakdowns. For consistency, we assumed an average vehicle fuel efficiency of about <Link href="/vehicles">25 miles per gallon</Link> and a gas price of $3.80 per gallon (roughly the current U.S. average).
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Using a <Link href="/road-trip-cost-calculator">road trip route planner</Link>, we estimated driving distances for each route and then calculated fuel costs by multiplying distance by fuel price (distance ÷ MPG × $3.80). Keep in mind fuel prices vary by region and season, so actual fuel expenses may differ.

                For lodging, we assumed a mid-range hotel cost of around $150 per night. This can fluctuate, as the average U.S. hotel was about <Link href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SEHB?output_view=data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$196/night in May 2025</Link>.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                We'll mention budget options (like campgrounds or motels) and luxury options (boutique hotels or resorts) for context, but our sample budgets use mid-range accommodations. Food costs are estimated at roughly $40 per person per day, assuming a mix of affordable meals and the occasional restaurant.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Of course, travelers can save by picnicking or splurge on fine dining, so consider your personal dining style. We also included typical attraction fees for key sights on each route so you can plan for sightseeing.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                All cost estimates are for a solo traveler (one person) per trip, but many expenses, such as gas and lodging, can be shared if you travel with others. Your actual trip costs will depend on your vehicle, travel style, and choices, so use our estimates as a starting point.

This famous highway, often dubbed the "Mother Road," winds through 8 states and countless small towns, deserts, and roadside attractions.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Highlights include the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the Blue Whale of Catoosa in Oklahoma, Cadillac Ranch in Texas, and the classic western landscapes of Arizona. To fully experience the nostalgia and sights of Route 66, plan for roughly two weeks on the road.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Late spring or autumn is ideal to avoid the extreme heat of mid-summer in the Southwest portions. Early summer can also be pleasant for this cross-country journey.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Fuel Cost</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Driving the entire Route 66 will cover about 2,400 miles. At <Link href="/vehicles">25 MPG</Link> and $3.80/gallon, fuel cost comes out around $380 (give or take, depending on detours and local gas prices).
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                If you're driving an RV or a classic car with lower MPG, expect higher fuel costs. For most modern cars, budgeting roughly $350-$400 for gas on this route is reasonable.

                Accommodation along Route 66 can range from rustic roadside motels to modern hotels in big cities. For a two-week trip (about 13 nights), a mid-range lodging budget is roughly $1,950-$2,000 total.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                One appeal of Route 66 is that many classic sights are free or low-cost photo opportunities. For example, Cadillac Ranch in Texas has free entry (just bring spray paint!).
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Nonetheless, you'll likely stop at some museums and parks along the way. Here are some notable attractions:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc text-lg pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Gateway Arch, St. Louis:</strong> Iconic 630-foot arch with tram ride to the top ($15-20 per adult).</li>
                <li><strong>Route 66 Museums:</strong> There are small Route 66 museums in states like Oklahoma and Arizona (admission often $5-$10, sometimes by donation).</li>
                <li><strong>Meramec Caverns, Missouri:</strong> A famous cavern attraction ($25 for tours).</li>
                <li><strong>Petrified Forest National Park (Arizona):</strong> If you detour slightly, this park (which Route 66 used to pass by) has a $25 vehicle entry fee.</li>
                <li><strong>Santa Monica Pier (California):</strong> Free to stroll (rides or games extra), a celebratory finish at the Pacific Ocean!</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Overall, budget around $100-$150 for paid attractions on Route 66, which should cover a few museum visits, a cavern tour, and other must-sees. Many roadside stops won't cost a dime.

This drive treats you to towering redwoods, dramatic cliffs over the Pacific, and charming seaside towns.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Major highlights include the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, the Monterey Bay area (and famed Monterey Aquarium), Big Sur's rugged coastline, Hearst Castle at San Simeon, the beaches of Santa Barbara, and lively Los Angeles on the way to San Diego.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Many consider this route one of the most popular road trip routes for its ocean views. The winding roads and spectacular vistas make it a photographer's dream.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Late spring through early fall offers the sunniest skies (June-August are peak tourist months; September often has great weather with fewer crowds). Winters are rainy with occasional mudslide closures along Big Sur, so check conditions if traveling off-season.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Fuel Cost</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The PCH route (approximately 600 miles) isn't too long, but its winding nature means you won't get great gas mileage in some sections. With our assumptions (600 miles, 25 MPG, $3.80/gal), fuel cost is about $90.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                It's wise to budget around $100 for gas in case you take side trips (like the 17-Mile Drive in Monterey or detours to wineries). Gasoline can be pricier in California than the national average, especially in remote coastal stretches, so $3.80 might be conservative.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Lodging Options</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Coastal California can be pricey for accommodations. For a 5-day trip (4 nights), a middle-of-the-road lodging budget is around $600 (assuming some nights less in smaller towns, some more in popular areas).

                A lot of the PCH's beauty is free. Scenic pullouts, state beaches, and small towns to explore cost nothing. But there are some notable attractions worth budgeting for:

              </ul>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                You might spend around $100-$120 on attractions if you hit an aquarium and a castle tour and pay a few park fees. Many viewpoints and beaches cost nothing.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Don't forget to factor in bridge tolls. The Golden Gate Bridge into SF is about $8, but leaving SF southbound is free.

Often called "America's Favorite Drive," this scenic byway offers stunning mountain vistas, lush forests, and cultural heritage sites.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The parkway itself is the destination, with numerous overlooks, hiking trails, waterfalls, and historic sites along the way. You'll find charming mountain towns like Asheville, NC, and natural wonders such as Linville Gorge and Grandfather Mountain.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The speed limit is 45 mph or less throughout, encouraging a leisurely pace to enjoy the scenery. To truly appreciate this route, plan for at least 3-5 days, though many travelers take a week to explore the area thoroughly.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Mid-May through June for spring wildflowers, or September through October for spectacular fall foliage. Summer offers lush green landscapes but can bring fog and afternoon thunderstorms. Winter often sees partial closures due to snow and ice.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Fuel Cost</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The full 469-mile route requires less fuel than you might expect. Using our standard calculation (469 miles ÷ 25 MPG × $3.80/gal), you're looking at about $71 for fuel.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                However, the mountainous terrain with constant elevation changes can reduce your vehicle's fuel efficiency. Additionally, you'll likely take detours to explore nearby attractions. Budget around $90-$100 for gas to be safe.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Gas stations are scarce on the parkway itself, so fill up in towns before entering long stretches. The parkway has limited services, particularly in remote sections.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Lodging Options</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                For a 5-night trip along the Blue Ridge Parkway, accommodations can vary widely. Assuming mid-range lodging, budget approximately $750 total for lodging.

                A popular option is to mix accommodations, perhaps splurging for a night or two in Asheville while camping or staying in more affordable lodging elsewhere. Book well in advance for fall foliage season, when prices increase and availability becomes limited.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Attractions & Activities</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                One of the best aspects of the Blue Ridge Parkway is that many of its attractions are free. The parkway itself has no entrance fee, and most overlooks, visitor centers, and many hiking trails are accessible at no cost.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Here are some notable attractions and their costs:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc text-lg pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Grandfather Mountain:</strong> Features the Mile-High Swinging Bridge and wildlife habitats ($24 adult admission).</li>
                <li><strong>Biltmore Estate (Asheville):</strong> America's largest home with gardens and winery ($70-90 depending on season, advance purchase recommended).</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Bridge State Park (Virginia):</strong> Historic natural limestone arch ($8 entry fee).</li>
                <li><strong>Mabry Mill (Virginia):</strong> Historic gristmill and blacksmith shop (free to visit).</li>
                <li><strong>Folk Art Center (North Carolina):</strong> Traditional and contemporary crafts of the Southern Appalachians (free admission).</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                For a 5-day trip, budget around $100-$150 for attractions, depending on your interests. If you plan to visit the Biltmore Estate, add its admission to your budget separately, as it's a significant expense.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Hiking is a popular activity along the parkway, with trails ranging from easy walks to challenging mountain climbs. Most trailheads are free to access, making this an economical way to experience the area's natural beauty.

While it's the shortest route on our list, what it lacks in distance it makes up for in jaw-dropping scenery and outdoor adventure opportunities.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                This alpine road crosses the Continental Divide at Logan Pass (elevation 6,646 feet) and offers spectacular views of mountains, glaciers, valleys, and pristine lakes. Wildlife sightings are common, including mountain goats, bighorn sheep, and occasionally bears.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Though the drive itself can be completed in about 2 hours, most visitors spend 3-4 days exploring the park, using the road as their main access point to trailheads, viewpoints, and visitor centers.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> The road is typically fully open from late June/early July to mid-October, depending on snowfall. July and August offer the warmest weather but also the largest crowds. Early September provides a sweet spot of fewer visitors and still-pleasant weather.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The Going-to-the-Sun Road itself is only 50 miles long, requiring minimal fuel. However, getting to Glacier National Park will involve additional travel. For our calculation, we'll assume you're driving around the park for 3 days, covering about 150 total miles.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                At our standard rate (150 miles ÷ 25 MPG × $3.80/gal), fuel within the park would cost about $23. But the mountainous terrain and frequent stops will reduce fuel efficiency, so budget around $30 for in-park driving.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Remember to fill up before entering the park, as gas stations inside are limited and typically more expensive. The towns of West Glacier and St. Mary at either end of the road have gas stations.

                For a 3-night stay in or near Glacier National Park during peak season, accommodations can be quite expensive and book up months in advance. Mid-range lodging will cost approximately $600 total.

                Follow in the footsteps of 19th-century pioneers on this historic route that loosely traces the <Link href="https://www.viator.com/Jackson-Hole-attractions/Yellowstone-National-Park/d5261-a10723?pid=P00255194&mcid=42383&medium=link&medium_version=selector&campaign=best-road-trip-routes-usa-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oregon Trail</Link>. This road trip covers approximately 1,100 miles from Oregon City (near Portland) eastward to Wyoming, traveling in the opposite direction of the original pioneers.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The journey takes you through diverse landscapes including the Columbia River Gorge, eastern Oregon's high desert, Idaho's Snake River Plain, and across the Rocky Mountains to Wyoming's sweeping prairies.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Historical landmarks along the way include Fort Boise in Idaho, Fort Hall near Pocatello, and Fort Bridger in Wyoming. In Wyoming, you can see actual wagon wheel ruts carved into rock at Guernsey and visit Independence Rock, where pioneers carved their names as they passed.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                While not on the original trail, a worthwhile detour takes you to Yellowstone or Grand Teton National Parks, showcasing the natural wonders that awaited those who completed the frontier journey.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Summer is best, following the original pioneers who traveled May through September. Snow can linger in Wyoming and mountain passes into late spring. Aim for June through early October, with late spring or early fall offering milder weather and fewer crowds than peak summer.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Fuel Cost</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The Oregon-to-Wyoming trek covers about 1,100 miles, costing approximately $180 in fuel (1,100 miles ÷ 25 MPG × $3.80/gal). If you incorporate major detours to Yellowstone or Grand Teton, add a few hundred miles and another $30-$50 in fuel costs.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Plan for around $180-$230 total in fuel depending on your side trips. Keep in mind that distances between gas stations in the high desert can be long, so it's wise to keep your tank topped up whenever possible.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                For a 7-day journey (6 nights) along the Oregon Trail, accommodations vary from simple motels to historic inns. Mid-range lodging will cost approximately $900 total.

                    Expect to pay around $150/night for comfortable accommodations. Rates may be higher in Boise and Jackson (if you go that far south in Wyoming) and lower in small towns.

                    True luxury is limited on this pioneer route, but lodges near Jackson Hole or fancy cabins can cost $250+ per night if you're looking to splurge.

                For a unique experience, consider Oregon Trail-themed inns or ranch stays. Some farms and ranches in Wyoming take guests, offering an authentic taste of frontier life. Otherwise, chain hotels in cities and simple roadside motels will be your main choices.

This route connects sites that highlight Southern heritage from colonial times and the Civil War to the Civil Rights Movement and Creole culture.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Begin in Charleston, a beautifully preserved historic city with cobblestone streets and antebellum homes, where the Civil War's first shots were fired at Fort Sumter. Next, consider passing through Savannah, Georgia, another charming historic port city with its iconic moss-draped oak trees and garden squares.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Continue inland through Alabama, visiting Montgomery (the first Confederate capital and a crucible of Civil Rights history), and perhaps Selma or Birmingham for their significant civil rights landmarks. You might dip down to the Gulf Coast via Mobile, Alabama (with its own Mardi Gras history) or travel through Mississippi's heritage towns like Natchez with its antebellum mansions.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Finally, end your journey in New Orleans, the vibrant city of jazz, diverse heritage, and legendary cuisine. The French Quarter, Garden District, and surrounding bayous offer a fitting finale to this cultural exploration.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Spring (March through May) offers pleasant weather, azaleas in bloom, and lively festivals. Fall (October-November) is also nice with cooler temperatures and fewer crowds. Summer is hot and humid, and hurricane season runs June-November, peaking August-September. Winter is generally mild in this region, though occasionally chilly or rainy.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Covering around 800 miles, this drive will consume roughly 32 gallons of gas (at 25 MPG × $3.80/gal), costing about $120 in fuel. If you take detours to see plantations along Louisiana's River Road between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, or to explore the Mississippi coast, your mileage will increase.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Budget $120-$150 to comfortably cover gasoline for this Southern journey. Gas prices tend to be relatively affordable throughout the South compared to national averages.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                For a week-long trip (6-7 nights) that allows you to savor the stops, accommodations vary widely from historic inns to modern hotels. Mid-range lodging will cost approximately $900 total.

                    Around $150/night is a good average. Charleston and New Orleans are the pricey bookends (possibly $200+ for downtown hotels), whereas places in between may be cheaper (~$120).

                    Splurge at a historic inn in Charleston or a French Quarter hotel in New Orleans ($250-$300+ per night). Consider one fancy night balanced with simpler lodgings elsewhere.

                Staying in city centers (Charleston's historic district or New Orleans' French Quarter) is wonderful but costly. Staying just outside these areas and commuting in can save money on both room rates and parking fees.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">

Roughly following U.S. Highway 2 for much of the way, this transcontinental journey offers an incredible variety of landscapes.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                You'll start by the Puget Sound and Cascade Mountains, traverse the vast plains of Montana and North Dakota, wind through the Northwoods of Minnesota and Wisconsin, dip into the Great Lakes region, then cross New England's forests and White Mountains to the rocky Maine coast.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Highlights include Glacier National Park in Montana (an absolute must-stop for alpine scenery), the remote Badlands of North Dakota, crossing the Mississippi headwaters in Minnesota, and the lakeshores of Michigan where you might take a ferry to Mackinac Island.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                You can choose to pass through Ontario, Canada or stay in the U.S. via Michigan's Upper Peninsula. If taking the Canadian route, the cities of Montreal or Ottawa offer cultural diversions. The journey concludes with New England gems like the Green Mountains (VT), White Mountains (NH), and the stunning Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Summer is essential for this northern route, as much of it goes through areas that are snowbound or frigid in winter. Aim for June through early September. Late summer (August) is ideal for Glacier National Park, as Going-to-the-Sun Road is usually fully open by early July. Early fall (September) can be beautiful in Maine for foliage, but you risk cold weather in the Rockies.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                This is one of the longest routes you can drive in the U.S., covering around 3,500 miles coast-to-coast. At 25 MPG and $3.80/gallon, that's about 140 gallons of gas, costing roughly $530 for fuel.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                If you take detours to see national parks or dip into Canada and back, add some extra. Budget in the $500-$600 range for gas. Gasoline prices can vary; expect potentially higher prices in remote parts of Montana or in Canada if you go that way.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Pro-tip: Fill up before entering isolated sections (like before driving Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, or stretches of North Dakota) to avoid paying premium rates at the only gas station for miles.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Given the plethora of options, an attractions budget of $120 is a rough middle-ground that might cover two national park entrance fees and a special tour or ferry ride. If you plan to hit several national parks on this and other trips, the $80 America the Beautiful annual pass could save money.

The route from Phoenix, Arizona to Grand Canyon National Park is only about 230 miles one-way, but you'll want to take your time to fully appreciate the dramatic scenery changes.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                On the way, you'll experience the stunning red rock country of Sedona, high-altitude forests around Flagstaff, and finally the awe-inspiring Grand Canyon. This popular route showcases Arizona's incredible diversity, from saguaro-filled Sonoran Desert around Phoenix to the world's most famous canyon.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                You might also include nearby attractions like Montezuma Castle (ancient cliff dwellings), Walnut Canyon near Flagstaff, or Meteor Crater in Winslow. If you have more time, the drive could be extended to Monument Valley on the Arizona/Utah border or to Page, Arizona (Horseshoe Bend, Antelope Canyon) for even more desert wonders.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Spring (March-May) and Fall (September-November) are ideal with pleasant weather in Phoenix and comfortable temperatures at the Grand Canyon's higher elevation. Summer is peak season at the Grand Canyon but very hot in Phoenix (100°F+). Winter is mild in Phoenix, but the Grand Canyon's South Rim is cold and can get snow; roads generally remain open, but some facilities close in winter.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Fuel Cost</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Driving from Phoenix to the Grand Canyon via Sedona (a common scenic route) is approximately 250 miles. At our standard calculation (250 miles ÷ 25 MPG × $3.80/gal), a one-way trip costs about $38 in fuel, or around $76 for a round trip.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                If you add side excursions like Sedona's backroads or detours to Meteor Crater or Monument Valley, your mileage will increase. It's wise to budget $50-$90 for gas depending on your exact plans and exploration within Grand Canyon National Park.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Lodging Options</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                For a 3-day mini trip, you'd likely stay 1 night in Sedona or Flagstaff and 1 night near the Grand Canyon. Mid-range lodging will cost approximately $300 total for 2 nights.
              </p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Sedona has some cheaper motels on the outskirts (~$100), and Flagstaff is a college town with budget hotels ($80-$120). Camping at Grand Canyon's Mather Campground is only $18/night (reserve in advance!).
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Around $150/night can usually get a decent place. In Sedona, this might be the lower end, as it's a tourist town. In Tusayan (by Grand Canyon), rooms often exceed $150 in peak season.
                  </p>
                </div>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Sedona has luxury resorts and spas ($300+ per night). Grand Canyon has historic lodges on the rim (El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge) at $200-$300, but they're very hard to book.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Book early if traveling in popular months, as hotels around the Grand Canyon fill up quickly. Flagstaff is more affordable if you stay there and drive to the Canyon for a day trip (1.5 hour drive).

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Attractions & Activities</h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The natural scenery is the star of this road trip. Here are some notable attractions along the way:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc text-lg pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Sedona Red Rock State Park:</strong> Beautiful park with hiking trails ($7 per adult entry).</li>
                <li><strong>Chapel of the Holy Cross (Sedona):</strong> Iconic church built into red rocks (free, donation appreciated).</li>
                <li><strong>Jeep tour in Sedona:</strong> Optional adventure: off-road tours run ~$100 per person. If on a tight budget, skip and drive to trailheads yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Montezuma Castle National Monument:</strong> On route north of Phoenix with well-preserved cliff dwellings ($10 per adult).</li>
                <li><strong>Grand Canyon National Park (South Rim):</strong> Entry $35 per vehicle (valid 7 days). Includes all rim overlooks and visitor centers.</li>
                <li><strong>Meteor Crater (Winslow, AZ):</strong> If detouring on I-40 east of Flagstaff, see an enormous meteor impact site ($25 adult ticket).</li>
                <li><strong>Lowell Observatory (Flagstaff):</strong> Historic observatory where Pluto was discovered (~$25 admission, great for stargazing nights).</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                For a simple trip, your only required fees are likely the Grand Canyon entry ($35) and maybe a state park or monument (~$10). That's around $45 in basic attraction fees.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Optional splurges include a helicopter tour over the Grand Canyon (~$300+ per person) or a mule ride ($150+). However, the views from the rim trails are free and spectacular.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Going on any of these road trips offers a unique way to experience the USA's landscapes and culture, but as we've shown, the cost of a road trip can vary dramatically depending on the route and your travel style. Shorter trips like the Florida Keys jaunt might run only a few hundred dollars, whereas spending two weeks on Route 66 or crossing the entire country can climb into the few thousands.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The good news is that road trip budgets are highly flexible. To save money:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc text-lg pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Consider traveling in shoulder seasons (lower lodging rates)</li>
                <li>Pack a cooler to cut food costs</li>
                <li>Take advantage of free attractions (national forests, scenic overlooks, picnic areas)</li>
                <li>Camp or stay in cheaper accommodations some nights to significantly reduce costs</li>
                <li>Plan your fuel stops smartly; fuel apps can help find cheaper gas along your route</li>
                <li>Drive at a steady, <Link href="/vehicles">fuel-efficient pace</Link> to stretch your gas mileage</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Each trip has its own cost profile: for example, a Pacific Coast Highway budget will skew toward higher lodging costs due to California prices, whereas a Great River Road trip might involve more days on the road (thus more gas and lodging overall, but perhaps cheaper accommodations in rural areas).
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Routes that hit many national parks (like the Great Northern or Great American Trip) might have more attraction fees. In those cases, an annual national parks pass for $80 can pay off. On the other hand, routes heavy on natural scenery (Blue Ridge Parkway, for instance) offer tons of free entertainment in the form of hikes and views.
